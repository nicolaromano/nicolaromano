- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicolaromano
- 👀 I’m a researcher at the University of Edinburgh using a mix of bioinformatics and _wet-lab_ approaches to study how heterogeneous populations of cells in the pituitary gland work as a population to decode signals from the brain and the environment.
- 🌱 I love to always learn new things related to data and image analysis, maybe with a bit of machine learning here and there! And I actually teach a lot of that, using R and Python!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project related to studying heterogeneity in cell populations and how that leads to emergent population behaviours.
- 📫 Reach me at nicola.romano(at)ed.ac.uk, or <a href=https://qoto.org/@nicolaromano rel="me">🐘 @nicolaromano</a> (or 🐦 [@\_nicoromano\_](https://twitter.com/_nicoromano_) but really, try using 🐘)
